# Probably the best Flag guessing game ever

## What I need to do 

- The backend should have a mongoose wrapper mongo db which saves high scores of users with their username and the date of the score. 
    1. displayname = string typed by user on completion of their round
    2. score - calculated based on their performance during the round.
    3. the date the score was acheived. calculated by mongoose.
